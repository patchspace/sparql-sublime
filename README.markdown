# SPARQL package for Sublime Text

For installation, clone this repository into your sublime Package directory, e.g.:

 		$> cd ~/.config/sublime-text/Packages/User
		$> git clone https://github.com/patchspace/sparql-sublime

Sublime should be immediately updated.

This package currently just contains a language definition for SPARQL that follows the [official SPARQL grammar][sparql-grammar] as closely as I could manage.

Any questions feel free to open an issue or just email me at [ash.moran@patchspace.co.uk][email].
